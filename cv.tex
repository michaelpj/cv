  I did a wide variety of work at Semmle, including:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Programming language design for the logic language QL.
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Designed and implemented a higher-order module system, enabling generic programming in QL
          for the first time.
      \item Designed and implemented a recursive aggregate semantics, allowing efficient computation of
          additional graph algorithms in QL.
      \end{itemize}
    \item Compiler and optimizer engineering.
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Implemented multi-stage caching of compilation and optimization results,
          improving compilation speed by orders of magnitude in common cases.
      \end{itemize}
    \item Leadership and management of the QL team.
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Implemented simple time forecasting for team objectives.
      \item Managed the implementation of parallel query evaluation, which was a
        six month project but delivered on time.
      \end{itemize}
    \item Research and intellectual property development.
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Published original research on incremental computation, and implemented
          the material in our evaluator.
      \end{itemize}
    \item Internal code health initiatives.
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Replaced several home-grown logging frameworks with single open-source
        solution across the whole codebase.
      \item Managed the process of making most of our QL code open-source.
      \end{itemize}
    \item Offensive security research and variant analysis with QL.
    \item Customer success and sales engineering.
  \end{itemize}

  This was a research project and consultancy focussed on social impact in technology and
  entrepreneurship. Some examples of work that I did:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Advised companies, institutions, and individual entrepreneurs on impact strategy.
    \item Developed qualitative and quantitative modelling techniques for
      assessing the potential impact of startups.
    \item Interviewed experts and conducted synoptic desk research to break down problem areas.
  \end{itemize}
